          <p class="text-center text-white">
            The purpose of this project was to create a data-driven menu
            utilizing React JS, VS Code, and Node.js. In the project I created 3
            components, these were MenuApp, Menu, and MenuItem. The overall
            project output was a restaurant menu containing a list of menu
            items, and their corresponding description. The menu items were also
            sorted to either Dinner or Dessert. Users could scroll up and down
            and sort through the menu. There was no specific reason for my
            layout choice, I was just aiming to make it look as close as
            possible to the tutorial.

          <p class="text-center text-white">
            When I started this project I had little to no experience using
            Node.js and React JS. It seemed like an impossible task for me to
            design an application with components that could pass on data and
            objects. Luckily, I didn't give up and after hours of trial and
            error and watching tutorials, I was able to complete the assignment
            meeting all the requirements. Though, it wouldn't have been possible
            without patience and hard work.

          <p class="text-center text-white">
            This project I created utilizing React JS as well. The project
            includes two screens, one for repetition exercises and one for
            duration exercises. The project consists of a main menu of
            exercises. The user clicks on an exercise, and they would be taken
            to a corresponding screen wether the exercise is a duration or
            repetition exercise. The duration screen consists of a timer, and
            the repetition screen consists of a rep counter. Again for my design
            I aimed to make it look like the one in the tutorial, since the main
            goal was tp get it to function.

            Problems I had and how I solved them:
          </h3>
          <p class="text-center text-white">
            My biggest problems in this project were how to create screens and
            how to import a timer. I was able to create the screens using
            functional components and if conditionals. This would determine what
            would be displayed on the screen depending on the option selected.
            To solve the timer issue, I used online resources to design my very
            own timer. I have to say it wasn't an easy task, but it was my
            proudest part of the assignment.

          <p class="text-center text-white">
            In this project, we stopped utilizing React, and started using React
            Native, which is more suitable for mobile development. In this
            project I designed an application where users can add a list of todo
            items, and delete them when they are done. The users can also make
            an account or login if they already have one to access their list.
            The app consists of a stack navigator, for users to move between the
            login, registration, and main Todo screen. For the layout I went for
            a range of blues, and for the contents I decided to center-align
            everything. Overall, it was my most complex application.

            Problems I had and how I solved them:
          </h3>
          <p class="text-center text-white">
            My main problems in this project were getting the stack navigator to
            work and validating the registration page. It was my first time
            using the stack navigator, so I really didn't comprehend it, but
            after trial and error I was able to figure it out. In terms of
            validation, I used a series of rules I found online to make the
            validation functions. Once I figured out how to validate all the
            inputs, I added a button that would registrate the user, and take
            them to the Todo screen.

          <p class="text-center text-white">
            For this project I had to design a quiz for mobile devices using
            React Native. I had to use React Native Navigation, and I had to
            incorporate a Question Component and a Summary Component. There also
            had to be three different types of questions, True/False, Multiple
            Choice, and Multiple Answer. To use the application,a user would
            answer all the questions and submit them. Then the user would see
            the summary page at which returns all the questions with the answers
            chosen, and the amount correct. For the layout I tried to keep
            everything centered, and I made the submit and next question
            buttonds green so it would be easy for users to see. I also added an
            option so that when users chose an answer it would color in, to let
            them know it was selected. I aimed to make the project fully
            functional with a simple yet professional design.

          </h3>
          <p class="text-center text-white">
            My biggest problems when developing this application were the
            multiple answer questions, and the summary page. I was able to
            figure out the multiple answer questions thanks to the tutorial, but
            even then it took me more than an hour of brainstorming to get it
            right. I was able to do the summary screen thanks to a
            selectedChoices function which kept track of what users selected. If
            it matched the correct answer it would change the score, and
            highlight it in green at the end. It was difficult, but it was one
            of my favorite projects.
