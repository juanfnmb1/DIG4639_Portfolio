          <h1>Assignment Description:</h1>
          <p>
            For this assignment, I was tasked with designing a wireframe for an
            exercise app. My application includes a main screen to select the
            exercises, a repetition screen, and a duration screen. The
            repetition screen includes a counter, and the duration screen
            includes a timer. For example, if a user clicks on running on the
            main screen, it will take them to the duration screen, where they
            can set a timer.

          <h1>My Design:</h1>
          <p>
            I designed this with Adobe XD. It is what I am most familiar with.
            Though, with this assignment, I was able to polish up on things I
            had forgotten. I decided to go with a vertical layout for the main
            screen. With the idea that users can swipe through the options. I
            also decided to add images to all screens to make users aware of all
            options. Lastly, I went with rectangular containers for all
            components.

            For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a wireframe for a
            to-do app. Basically, an app where a user can add items they need to
            due with a date to help them manage their schedule. The design had
            to include a login page, a main screen, and a page for user
            identity. On the main screen, there is a list of to-do items. Here,
            users can add new items, delete items, or checkmark items that were
            already done. The profile screen shows user identity and allows them
            to update it if needed.

            For this assignment, again, I decided to go with Adobe XD. Though,
            instead of neatness and styling, I focused more on including all the
            required content and organizing it. The first screen is a simple
            login screen, which allows users to login by email if chosen. The
            main screen is a vertical stack of items, with buttons hinting at
            users of their purpose, such as a delete button. Lastly, for the
            profile screen, I included information such as date of birth,
            country, email, and profile picture.

          <p>
            For Exercise 9, I was tasked with designing a wireframe for a flash
            card app. In the application, the user should be able to create,
            delete, and edit their flash cards and view them in random order for
            study purposes. The design had to include two screens: a main screen
            with the flash card sets and a flash card screen where the users
            could study and view the cards in random order.
          </p>

          <p>
            Again, I utilized Adobe XD for this assignment. I created three
            screens instead of two. A main screen, a flash card screen, and a
            card edit screen. Therefore, I went above and beyond for this task.
            I decided to go with a vertical list of flash cards so users could
            pick the set they wanted and study it. I also included buttons for
            things like going through the list and flipping through the cards.
